The Stedi starter kit contains a number of resources to help you get started building your own custom EDI solutions and B2B integrations on Stedi. We are going to be shipping new examples and resources weekly, so please [contact us](mailto:team@stedi.con) if you have any requests.

## Starter kit resources
- [Mappings examples](https://github.com/Stedi/starter-kit/tree/main/mappings-examples): a curated collection of prebuilt [Mappings](https://www.stedi.com/docs/mappings) that you can import and run on Stedi with a single click.
- [Converter examples](https://github.com/Stedi/starter-kit/tree/main/converter-examples): examples on how to use the [Stedi Converter API](https://www.stedi.com/docs/converter) with axios.
- [EDI Core examples](https://github.com/Stedi/starter-kit/tree/main/edi-core-examples/postman-collections-for-import): a collection of examples and templates on how to use the Stedi APIs using Postman
- [Integration tutorials](https://github.com/Stedi/starter-kit/tree/main/integration-tutorials): our repository for deploying prebuilt end-to-end integration solutions

## Authenticating with Stedi

1. Go to [Terminal](https://terminal.stedi.com/) and create a user for login. Complete the signup flow by naming your account and uploading an (optional) logo.
2. On the homepage, click on `API Keys` on the right side of your screen.
6. Click `Generate API key` and save that key securely (you won't be able to retreive later)

Now you are ready to authenticate with the Stedi API. In all API calls to Stedi you must include the API key as a Header such as `"Authorization" : "Key <STEDI_API_KEY>"`.
