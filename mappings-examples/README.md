## How to use this repo

The folders above contain various examples of production-ready Stedi Mappings. 

Each example can be deployed to your Stedi account by clicking the green `Run on Stedi` button in the folder's README. 

Once the Mapping is deployed in your Stedi account, you can either (1) [start calling the Mapping](https://www.stedi.com/docs/api/mappings) to transform your files or (2) [edit the Mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0sPfOrPL3o) to meet any additional requirements.
