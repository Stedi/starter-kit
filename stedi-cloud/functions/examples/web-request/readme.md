# Web request Function (advanced)

Welcome to the `web request` tutorial of Stedi Functions. In this guide, we will deploy a Function packaged with your own libraries, so you can learn how the service works. The tutorial should take you 30 minutes to complete and can be completed within Stedi's free tier. 

We encourage to take a quick look at our "hello world" tutorial before starting this one. We build on the same concepts that were explained there in this guide. One difference is that we will also use your local CLI here to run a few commands to build and package your function.

## Getting Started

We assume you already have a Stedi Terminal account.
