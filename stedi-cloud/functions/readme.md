# Stedi Cloud - Functions

In this repository, you will find tutorials and examples to help you get started with Stedi Functions. Functions are the first generally available service on the Stedi Cloud platform, which will allow you build full fledged B2B applications with its capabilities. 

# About Functions

Stedi Functions lets you develop and run JavaScript or TypeScript code on the Stedi Cloud platform. Functions are always triggered by an event happening on the Stedi platform, such as an API call. 

Once the Function is triggered, it executes your code and shuts down automatically afterwards. Functions can run anywhere between 1 milisecond and 29 seconds and you are only charged for the duration of the execution.

  graph LR;
      id1[Event on Stedi]-. triggers .-> id2;
      id2[Stedi Function]-. can request .->id4[Any Stedi or Internet API];
```Â 

Today, Functions can respond to requests coming from the Stedi API or Stedi Terminal.  We plan to add additional inputs for event triggers in the future. Your Function can make any request to a Stedi or external API.

## Examples

We include two basic examples to get you started;

### 1. Hello world (web browser based)

If you never used event driven functions before, we encourage you to take a look at our hello world example. This code will teach you the basics to start writing your own functions. You can complete the tutorial for this function from the Stedi Terminal in your webbrowser.

### 2. Web request function (CLI based)

If you are more familiar with event driven services (such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions or Google Cloud Functions), we encourage you to take a look at the web request example. Using this code, you can make an outbound web request from your function, i.e. to an external webhook. 

This function does need to be deployed using a Bash script in order to package and bundle the code. We expect to have the Stedi CLI, Stedi SDK and Stedi Formation support in the coming weeks).
